# ML_Regression_InsuranceCharges
This repo contains dataset and python notebook to predict charges for insurance based on some features of data.

Problem Statement
  You are tasked with building a predictive model to estimate medical insurance charges based on demographic and lifestyle attributes. The goal is to use Multiple Linear Regression and evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
________________________________________
Dataset Overview
You are provided with an Insurance Analytics Dataset containing the following features:
•	Input Features:
o	age: Age of the insured person.
o	Gender: Gender of the insured person (male, female).
o	bmi: Body Mass Index of the insured person.
o	children: Number of children covered by the insurance plan.
o	smoker: Smoking status of the insured person (yes, no).
o	region: Region where the insured resides (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest).
•	Target Variable:
o	charges: The medical insurance costs billed to the insured.

Tasks
1. Data Loading and Understanding
•	Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
•	Analyze the data types, missing values, and basic statistics for each column.
•	Identify the features and target variable.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Create visualizations to understand the distribution of the charges variable.
•	Examine relationships between charges and other features (e.g., bmi, age, smoker).
•	Check for multicollinearity among numerical features.
3. Data Preprocessing
•	Apply appropriate preprocessing steps for numerical and categorical columns:
o	Standardize numerical features (age, bmi, children).
o	Encode categorical features (Gender, smoker, region) using One-Hot Encoding.
•	Use a Column Transformer to consolidate preprocessing steps.
4. Pipeline Construction
•	Build a pipeline that includes:
o	Data preprocessing using the column transformer.
o	A Multiple Linear Regression model for prediction.
5. Model Training
•	Split the dataset into training and testing subsets (e.g., 80%-20% split).
•	Train the regression model on the training set using the pipeline.
6. Model Evaluation
•	Evaluate the model on the test data using the following metrics:
o	Mean Squared Error (MSE)
o	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
o	R-squared (R²)
•	Interpret the results and determine how well the model predicts charges.
7. Feature Importance Analysis
•	Analyze the coefficients of the regression model to identify the most impactful features influencing charges.
•	Discuss the implications of these findings.
8. Report Insights
•	Summarize your findings and suggest actionable insights based on:
o	The most significant features driving insurance charges.
o	The performance of the model.
o	Possible improvements to the analysis (e.g., feature engineering or alternative models).

Expected Deliverables
•	A comprehensive lab report that includes:
o	EDA results with visualizations.
o	Description of preprocessing steps and pipeline design.
o	Evaluation of model performance with relevant metrics.
o	Discussion of feature importance and insights.
•	A structured code implementation (optional if required).
________________________________________
Extensions (Optional)
•	Compare the results of Multiple Linear Regression with other models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests).
•	Investigate interaction terms (e.g., smoker × bmi) to enhance model performance.
•	Explore feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant predictors.
